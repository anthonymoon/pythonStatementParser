Example:

{
  "negate_transactions": true,
  "description_mapping": true
}

Description:

"negate_transactions" (default false) will multiply every transaction by negative one. Useful for Visa/Credit card accounts.
"description_mapping" (default false) will add a new column to the transactions CSV according to the following algorithm:
* The program will open "mapping.csv" (by defauly in the same directory as this file, but can be specified with another option)
* It will check if a transactions description matches any regex in the "regex" column. If it does, the transaction gets a new column called "category" which will get the value of "output" in "mapping.csv"


"description_mapping_path" (default is the account directory / mapping.csv). This is the mapping file that will be used above. It needs two columns. A regex column, and a output value.
